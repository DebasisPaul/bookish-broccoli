Not specific
Job Context
    • Founded to change billions of lives, Ding is currently the fastest growing consumer tech company of scale in Ireland. 76% of the world`s five billion mobile phones are prepaid and a quarter of those are out of top-up. Lack of mobile access holds everything back. Families can`t stay connected, knowledge isn`t shared, and new forms of e-commerce can`t be taken advantage of and therefore take longer to develop. This holds countries back, slowing economic development and curtailing living standards
