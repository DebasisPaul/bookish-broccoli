Tim Corey
United States
TX
A software developer who learned the hard way and now teaches others the easy way.Biography
I started programming professionally before I graduated high school. I immediately loved it. The only problem was that no one really taught me how to grow my skills. I spent years going down blind alleys and taking the wrong fork in the road in my quest to become a better software developer. Over time I finally figured it out, but even then I had gaps in my knowledge. When I finally started to get a good grasp on what software development was all about, I began to help others avoid my mistakes. From that came my YouTube channel (https://youtube.com/IAmTimCorey) and my training site (https://IAmTimCorey.com). I primarily teach C# but I also cover SQL and the web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).  tim@iamtimcorey.com Certifications
